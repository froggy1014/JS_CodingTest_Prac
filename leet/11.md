# 11. Container With Most Water

<pre>You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.</pre>

<pre>Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.</pre>

## My solution 

```js
const solution = (height) => {
  let lt = 0;
  let rt = height.length - 1;
  let answer = 0;
  while(lt < rt) {
    let width = rt - lt;
    let heightValue = Math.min(height[lt], height[rt]);
    let area = width * heightValue;
    answer = Math.max(answer, area);

    height[lt] < height[rt] ? lt++ : rt-- 
  }
  return answer;
}

console.log(solution([1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]))
```
